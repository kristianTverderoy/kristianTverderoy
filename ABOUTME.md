Hello there. My name is Kristian Tverderøy. Welcome to my github page. Here I will update my projects over the course of my career.
I am a 23 y.o Norwegian born male. Currently I am studying computer science and engineering at NTNU in Ålesund.

Stay tuned for some hopefully wicked projects in the future.
